# DirToText

A simple, free, lightweight tool that allows the user to select a folder and have the filenames within exported to a text format.

Fully functional, meant to showcase my ability to work with C#, XAML and WPF.

To run, download and unzip:
[DirToText.zip](https://github.com/ChristopherPerrault/DirToText/files/14066925/DirToText.zip)

Or clone this repo, open in Visual Studio, click Build -> Build DirToText, then click Build -> Publish DirToText.
Specify where the install file should reside, click Finish, and run setup.exe.

To uninstall, locate the program in Add/Remove Programs and follow the instructions.
